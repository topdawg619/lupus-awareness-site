    <article><p>Danielle’s lupus story began the way it does for too many women of color: unexplained chest pressure, rashes that refused to fade, and lingering fatigue that was written off as &quot;stress.&quot; It took four emergency room visits before a resident finally ran an ANA panel. Within days she had answers, but she also had a new mission—helping other young Black women get diagnosed sooner.</p>
<h2>Why her story matters</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delayed diagnosis remains the norm.</strong> On average it takes 6+ years for a person to secure a lupus diagnosis. Black women are still diagnosed three times more often than white women, yet we have less access to rheumatology consults.</li>
<li><strong>Documentation is leverage.</strong> Danielle keeps a standing symptom journal in her phone. When she walks into a clinic, she leads with data—dates, photos, labs. Providers respond differently when everything is timestamped.</li>
<li><strong>Family history is power.</strong> Once Danielle mapped out autoimmune issues on both sides of her family, physicians finally understood her risk. We’ve added her template to the downloads section so other families can do the same.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The moment something feels wrong, say it out loud. Don’t wait for the pain to validate you.” – Danielle</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Action items from Danielle’s playbook</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pair every flare with labs.</strong> Ask for complements, anti-dsDNA, CBC, CMP, urinalysis. Lupus is invisible unless the labs are timed with the symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>Use your village.</strong> Danielle rotates appointments with her sister, best friend, and fiancé so no one shoulders the emotional load alone.</li>
<li><strong>Request nurse navigators.</strong> Most academic centers offer them; they are the ones who can fast-track referrals when specialists are overbooked.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll continue to highlight Danielle’s advocacy work throughout Black History Month and our research notes will feed into a downloadable starter kit for newly diagnosed families.</p>
