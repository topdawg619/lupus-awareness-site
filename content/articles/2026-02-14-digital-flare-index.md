summary: "A 12-month pilot is pairing smartwatch biometrics, PRO surveys, and a Lupus Flare Risk Index blood test to predict flares 12 weeks in advance. Here’s why we’re paying attention."
---

The aiSLE® MGMT study from Progentec just opened enrollment across five community rheumatology clinics. Participants get:

- A validated **Lupus Flare Risk Index (L-FRI)** blood draw every three months
- A mobile app that pairs with a smartwatch to collect heart rate variability, activity, and sleep quality
- Weekly health-coach calls that review the biomarker risk score plus the patient’s self-reported symptoms

## Why it’s different

1. **Proactive scheduling.** Rheumatologists can prioritize limited office visits for the patients whose 12-week risk score is trending up, instead of reacting once organ damage has already happened.
2. **Better steroid decisions.** If a flare risk jumps, physicians can adjust immunosuppressants or steroids earlier, giving people a shot at staying out of the ER.
3. **Care equity focus.** Three of the five study sites are community clinics that already serve predominantly Black and Latina women—exactly where the tech should be piloted.

## What we’re doing next

- Building our own **Daily Flare Log** template to mirror the biomarkers with home vitals (blood pressure, weight, pain scores). It will live in the downloads folder this weekend.
- Mapping out a **watchlist of digital trials** so we can notify readers when enrollment opens near them.
- Interviewing study coordinators about data privacy and how L-FRI results show up inside electronic health records.

If you’re within driving distance of the participating clinics, email us and we’ll help you navigate the screening call.
