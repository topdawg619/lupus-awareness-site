    <article><p>The aiSLE® MGMT study from Progentec just opened enrollment across five community rheumatology clinics. Participants get:</p>
<ul>
<li>A validated <strong>Lupus Flare Risk Index (L-FRI)</strong> blood draw every three months</li>
<li>A mobile app that pairs with a smartwatch to collect heart rate variability, activity, and sleep quality</li>
<li>Weekly health-coach calls that review the biomarker risk score plus the patient’s self-reported symptoms</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why it’s different</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Proactive scheduling.</strong> Rheumatologists can prioritize limited office visits for the patients whose 12-week risk score is trending up, instead of reacting once organ damage has already happened.</li>
<li><strong>Better steroid decisions.</strong> If a flare risk jumps, physicians can adjust immunosuppressants or steroids earlier, giving people a shot at staying out of the ER.</li>
<li><strong>Care equity focus.</strong> Three of the five study sites are community clinics that already serve predominantly Black and Latina women—exactly where the tech should be piloted.</li>
</ol>
<h2>What we’re doing next</h2>
<ul>
<li>Building our own <strong>Daily Flare Log</strong> template to mirror the biomarkers with home vitals (blood pressure, weight, pain scores). It will live in the downloads folder this weekend.</li>
<li>Mapping out a <strong>watchlist of digital trials</strong> so we can notify readers when enrollment opens near them.</li>
<li>Interviewing study coordinators about data privacy and how L-FRI results show up inside electronic health records.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re within driving distance of the participating clinics, email us and we’ll help you navigate the screening call.</p>
